					I need to pretty up these blog pages... I feel like it's a bit (read: extremely) ugly. Time to go back to the locally hosted blog to test some things out...
					<div class="main-text-line-break"></div>
					Anyways, I went to camp! Happy news first - I made IOI. Childhood dream achieved. Woohoo! Now I can look back at laugh at myself from a month or two ago in <i>My Current Mentality</i>. Although I do think it was a bit dumb, it got me through another week of stress - that's all it was meant to do.
					<div class="main-text-line-break"></div>
					Now to be a bit more introspective. I'm probably just going to dump out a lot of thoughts I have...
					<div class="main-text-line-break"></div>
					I'm still in a bit of disbelief I got through this. In a way, I consider myself to be the only "normal" person competing - every other person either has years of experience and practice over even me, or inhuman work ethic, or pure genius, or a memory etched in stone, and so on. I don't consider myself to have any of these. Objectively speaking, I might be considered a child prodigy, but I do not believe that label to have any worth. I started earlier than others - so what? I have a crippling gaming addiction (although I do have other hobbies now), an absolutely horrid memory (both short term and long term), have motivation issues, and more. I believe myself to symbolize how far pure rational analysis and logical thinking can get you - nothing else. Nothing special.
					<div class="main-text-line-break"></div> 
					But also, even with all of this, I didn't win in the way I wanted to. Here's a message to anyone else who might be competing for IOI in the near future. It's not a problem solving contest. You can train and train, but it is unlikely that you will be significantly better than every other person you are competing with unless you have some external factor (in which case you don't need me for advice). Camp is much more like an endurance contest. Yes - it is very fun. But the problem is that it is <i>too</i> fun. It is nonstop fun activities day in and day out. No matter how fun it is, it gets exhausting. Add to this the food - I am used to a very balanced Asian home-cooked diet, which you can't really find at all in the South. Compound this with the general difficulty of sleeping, whether you have a considerate roommate (thankfully I did), whether you need absolute darkness (good luck with that), or loud sounds wake you up (earplugs are a MUST). Also, you might be sick - 30 people flying in on planes makes for at least one infectious person. Yes, problem solving ability is certainly important. But in the end, at least in my opinion, it is who gets affected the least by the environment who wins. Add on to this fact that I don't think I broke any problem-solving barriers in any of the camp contests - I didn't have any creative new ideas, or particularly good performances - just a bit heap of mediocrity, recombining problems I solved before. That is not how I wanted to win.
					<div class="main-text-line-break"></div> 
					And the last part - the other people. Practically all of the people competing in the top bracket know each other. And this is understating it. Many of us are good friends, people who had similar experiences and were united in their struggle to reach the top. But in the end, only four people will be selected for the final competition. People will win, but others still must lose. I feel really bad about this - it should be all of us going together as friends, not fighting over the spots that are there. But I justify all of this competition to myself in the following way - if they won, I would have lost with grace (or at least I tell myself that). Maybe this is an empty statement, but it is all I have.
					<div class="main-text-line-break"></div> 
					Anyways, I have to start on the next journey now. I can't take my spot on the team and then not get a gold medal. That would be disrepectful to the people I fought with over that golden seat.
